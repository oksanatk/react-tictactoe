# react-tictactoe

Made as inital learning practice with React.
Followed official React docs tutorial [here](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe)

## Additional Challenges I've Implemented:
  - [x] For the current move only, show “You are at move #…” instead of a button.
  - [x] Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
